        "title": "About Spair Money",
        "q1": "What is Spair Money?",
        "a1": "Spair Money is a simple app that helps you manage all your money in one place. You can track your spending, set budgets, save for goals, and see where your money goes—all in one easy-to-use platform.",
        "q2": "How does Spair Money work?",
        "a2": "It's really simple! You add your accounts and transactions manually or import from CSV. The app automatically sorts your spending into categories, helps you create budgets, and shows you how much you're saving. Everything is organized so you can see your finances at a glance.",
        "q3": "Do I need to be tech-savvy to use it?",
        "a3": "Not at all! Spair Money is designed for everyone. The interface is clean and easy to understand. If you can use a smartphone or computer, you can use Spair Money. No special skills needed!",
        "q4": "Is my financial information safe?",
        "a4": "Absolutely! We use the same security measures that banks use. Your data is encrypted (scrambled so only you can read it), and we never share your information with anyone. Your login details are handled by secure systems, and we follow strict privacy rules to keep your money information private."

      "plans": {
        "title": "Plans and Pricing",
        "q1": "What plans do you offer?",
        "a1": "We offer the {planName} plan (${priceMonthly} per month or ${priceYearly} per year) with unlimited access to all features. The plan comes with a 30-day free trial so you can try it risk-free. You get unlimited transactions, unlimited accounts, and access to all features including investments, advanced reports, CSV import/export, budgets, goals, and more.",
        "q2": "Can I try it for free?",
        "a2": "Yes! The {planName} plan comes with a 30-day free trial. You'll add your card to start the trial; you're only charged after the trial ends. If you decide it's not for you, cancel anytime and you won't be charged. If you cancel after subscribing, your plan stays active until the end of your billing cycle (monthly or annual). If you love it, your subscription will start automatically after 30 days.",
        "q3": "What happens after my free trial ends?",
        "a3": "If you don't cancel, your subscription will start automatically and you'll be charged for the plan you chose. You can cancel anytime; if you cancel, your plan stays active until the end of your current billing cycle (monthly or annual). No surprises!",
        "q4": "What do I get with the plan?",
        "a4": "The {planName} plan includes everything: unlimited transactions, unlimited accounts, track your investments, see detailed reports, import and export your data, add and import transactions manually or via CSV, get smart category suggestions, budgets, goals, receipt scanner, household members, and more.",
        "q5": "Can I switch plans later?",
        "a5": "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime from your account settings. If you upgrade, you get the new features right away. If you downgrade, the change happens at the end of your current billing period. You're always in control!",
        "q6": "Do you offer a discount if I pay yearly?",
        "a6": "Yes! Save 17% when you pay for a full year upfront. The {planName} plan is ${priceYearly} per year (that's only ${pricePerMonth} per month).",
        "q7": "Can I cancel anytime?",
        "a7": "Yes! You can cancel your subscription anytime from your account settings. When you cancel, your plan stays active until the end of your current billing cycle (monthly or annual). After that, you won't be charged again. It's that simple!",
        "q8": "Can I change my plan after I subscribe?",
        "a8": "Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade anytime from your account settings. Upgrades take effect immediately so you can start using new features right away. Downgrades happen at the end of your current billing period. You can also switch between monthly and yearly billing anytime."

      "features": {
        "title": "Features",
        "q1": "How do I add my accounts?",
        "a1": "In the Accounts section, click \"Add Account\" and enter your account details (name, type, initial balance). You can then add transactions manually or import them via CSV file.",
        "q2": "Can I sync my accounts automatically?",
        "a2": "We don't offer automatic bank or account syncing. You add transactions manually or import them via CSV file.",
        "q3": "Can I import my transactions from a file?",
        "a3": "Yes! If you have your transactions in a CSV file (like from Excel or another app), you can import them. The app will help you match up the columns in your file (like date, amount, description) with the right fields. You can even preview everything before importing to make sure it looks right!",
        "q4": "Can I download my data?",
        "a4": "Yes! You can export all your transactions as a CSV file anytime. This is great for keeping a backup, using your data in other tools, or for tax time. You can export everything or just filter what you need.",
        "q5": "How do budgets work?",
        "a5": "Budgets are super simple! You set a spending limit for each category (like groceries or entertainment) for the month. The app tracks how much you've spent and shows you with a progress bar. Green means you're doing great (under 90% of your budget), yellow means you're getting close (90-100%), and red means you've gone over. It's an easy way to stay on track!",
        "q6": "Can I track my investments?",
        "a6": "Yes! You can track all your investments. You can add different types of investment accounts (like TFSA, RRSP, crypto wallets, etc.), add your stocks, ETFs, crypto, bonds, and other investments, record when you buy or sell, and see how much your portfolio is worth. The app even calculates your average cost automatically!",
        "q7": "How do savings goals work?",
        "a7": "It's easy! Just tell the app how much you want to save and when you want to reach your goal. The app will figure out how much you need to save each month and show you when you'll reach your goal. You can see your progress anytime, which helps you stay motivated!",
        "q8": "Can my family use the same account?",
        "a8": "Yes! On the {planName} plan, you can invite family members to your account. Each person gets their own separate finances (their own transactions, accounts, budgets), but you as the account owner can see everyone's info to help manage things. It's perfect for couples or families who want to track their money separately but stay organized together.",
        "q9": "Can family members see each other's finances?",
        "a9": "No, they can't! Each family member has their own private financial data—their own transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, and investments. The account owner can see everyone's info to help manage things, but family members can't see each other's data. Your privacy is protected!",
        "q10": "How does the app know which category to use?",
        "a10": "The app is smart! It learns from how you've categorized transactions before. It looks at your past transactions (up to 12 months) and learns your patterns. When you add a new transaction or import from CSV, it suggests the most likely category. You can just click to accept it or change it if it's wrong. The more you use it, the smarter it gets!",
        "q11": "How do I remove an account?",
        "a11": "You can delete an account from the Accounts section. Your transactions for that account stay until you delete them. You can add the account again later if you want.",
        "q12": "How do I add or remove family members?",
        "a12": "On the {planName} plan, go to the 'Members' section in your account settings. You can invite family members by email—they'll get an invitation and can choose to join. As the account owner, you can see and manage everyone, and you can remove members anytime if needed."
      },
      "accountSupport": {
        "title": "Account and Support",
        "q1": "How do I sign up?",
        "a1": "It's free and easy! Just click 'Get Started' on the homepage. You'll need to provide your email address and create a password, then confirm your email. You'll add your card when you start your 30-day free trial—you're only charged after the trial ends. Cancel anytime; your plan stays active until the end of your billing cycle.",
        "q2": "I forgot my password. What do I do?",
        "a2": "No problem! On the login page, click 'Forgot my password' and enter your email address. We'll send you a link to reset your password. Make sure to check your inbox and spam folder—sometimes the email ends up there!",
        "q3": "How do I update my payment method?",
        "a3": "Easy! Go to your account settings and click on 'Billing'. From there, you can update your payment information anytime. We use Stripe (a trusted payment processor) to keep your payment info secure.",
        "q4": "Is my information private?",
        "a4": "Yes, absolutely! Your financial data belongs to you and only you. We use advanced security to make sure only you (and any family members you invite) can see your data. We never sell or share your information with anyone. Your privacy is our priority!",
        "q5": "How do I get help if I have questions?",
        "a5": "We're here to help! You can email us at support@spair.co anytime, or visit the 'Help & Support' section in the app after you sign in. Our team will get back to you and help with whatever you need!",
        "q6": "Do you offer support in other languages?",
        "a6": "Yes! Spair Money is available in multiple languages, and our support team can help you in various languages too. Just let us know your preferred language and we'll do our best to help!",
        "q7": "What happens if I delete my account?",
        "a7": "If you delete your account, all your data will be permanently deleted from our system immediately, as explained in our <policy></policy>. This can't be undone, so make sure to export your data first if you want to keep a copy!",

        "q1": "What devices can I use?",
        "a1": "You can use Spair Money on almost any device! It works on your computer, tablet, or smartphone—anything with a web browser. No need to download an app—just open your browser and go to the website. It works great on all screen sizes!",
        "q2": "Which web browsers work?",
        "a2": "Spair Money works on all popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. For the best experience, make sure you're using the latest version of your browser. It's free to update!",
        "q3": "Can I use it without internet?",
        "a3": "Right now, you need an internet connection to use Spair Money. But we're working on adding offline features so you can view and edit your transactions even when you're not connected. Stay tuned!",
        "q4": "Where is my data stored?",
        "a4": "Your data is stored securely in the cloud (online servers). This means you can access it from any device, anywhere. It's also automatically backed up, so you don't have to worry about losing your information. We use secure, trusted systems to keep everything safe."
